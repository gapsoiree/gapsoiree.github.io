When will that be, we hear you ask.</p>\n<p>We have booked in <strong>Saturday 4th June, 2022</strong> for the next Soirée. That time in the third quarter of the year was quite busy for many people, and looking ahead it appears it will be similar again. So we made the decision to move it a bit earlier in the year. It will be bigger and better, with another collection of local musicians and groups to entertain. There will be beer and wine. There will be more glorious food. There will be another beautiful art gallery. And of course there will be you, our wonderful patrons to enjoy the night. There will be more announcements in early 2022, so keep in touch for all the updates.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/Soiree-2022-Social-01.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-xs.jpg 300w ,https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-sm.jpg 480w ,https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-md.jpg 768w ,https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://gapsoiree.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Soiree-2022-Social-01-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"MINT performing at the 2021 Soirée\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>If you have a business and would be interested in sponsoring the Soirée in 2022, please <a href=\"mailto:msg@tgsspc.org.au\">contact us</a>.
