We will be taken to the imaginary country of Diaspora with folk tunes by <a href=\"https://gapsoiree.com/robert-bloodwood/\">Robert Bloodwood</a>. And finally, <a href=\"https://gapsoiree.com/monique-clare/\">Monique Clare</a> wields a cello and strikingly crafted vocals.</p>\n<p>Our friends at local artisan collective <a href=\"https://www.thegapcreative.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Gap Creative</a> will be showing artworks by their very talented artists in the art gallery. If you have visited any of their other exhibitions around our community, you will know the very high calibre of our local artists. These artworks will also be available for purchase if you would like to take some home.</p>\n<p>Set aside the evening of Saturday 16th September, grab your friends and family, secure some <a href=\"https://gapsoiree.com/tickets/\">tickets</a> and come along to enjoy some fabulous music, fantastic artwork, wine, food and terrific company.</p>\n<p>See you at the Soirée!</p>",
