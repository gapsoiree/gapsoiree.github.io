<p>The next <span style="font-weight: 400;">Soirée will be on Saturday 11 September 2021 at The Gap State School MPB, starting at 7pm. We have six artists and groups lined up to perform a variety of musical styles and genres.</span></p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: 400;">Soirée in 2019 was a restart of the long-running Soirée series presented by the Music Supporters Group, and was the first major event in the new Multi-Purpose Building at The Gap State School. This year's event will build on the successful 2019 event with more performances from local artists and groups. While we also now have COVID restrictions to deal with as well, we are planning for this year's event to be even bigger and better.</span></p>
<p>More announcements will be appearing soon, along with how and where to purchase tickets.
