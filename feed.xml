                <p>After a bit of downtime to recover from the Soirée of 2021, we are now back with planning for the 2022 event. When will that be, we hear you ask.</p>
<p>We have booked in <strong>Saturday 4th June, 2022</strong> for the next Soirée. That time in the third quarter of the year was quite busy for many people, and looking ahead it appears it will be similar again. So we made the decision to move it a bit earlier in the year. It will be bigger and better, with another collection of local musicians and groups to entertain. There will be beer and wine. There will be more glorious food. There will be another beautiful art gallery. And of course there will be you, our wonderful patrons to enjoy the night. There will be more announcements in early 2022, so keep in touch for all the updates.</p>

                <p>It is now only three more weeks until the Soirée, a night of fabulous music in The Gap with fantastic groups of local musicians performing on Saturday 11th September. Tickets are <a href="https://gapsoiree.com/tickets/">now available</a>, so make sure to book soon to get the seats of your choice.</p>
<p>Queenslanders really came together in the last few weeks to help keep community spread from the recent COVID outbreaks down to a minimum, and the results have spoken for themselves. Restrictions are now beginning to ease, so we are still confident that the Soirée will not be impacted. We were already following Qld Health's advice on being COVID Safe, and continue to monitor the latest advice. The ticketing is for allocated seating to keep in line with this advice, and we have also enabled a feature that the ticketing service provides of automatically blocking a seat between separate bookings. This will help to maintain social distancing between groups of attendees while seated. It won't allow us to get to 100% capacity (that would be a nice problem to have), but will help to keep some people more comfortable about being in an indoor venue at this time.</p>
<p>Masks will still likely be mandatory while indoors, and if that is the case we will be requiring the use of masks while in the venue. Even if these restrictions are relaxed before then, we would still encourage the use of masks.</p>
<p>So come out on Saturday 11th September to celebrate local music and catch up with friends, family and neighbours.</p>
<p>See you at the Soirée!</p>
