Their songs are a mix of storytelling, ballads, humour, poetry, and satire performed in a blend of folk, folk-rock, blues, jazz, country and world music elements. The band is quite entertaining inviting their audiences to tap their feet, listen to heart-warming stories, laugh, smile or sing along.<br><br>Frank has recorded and released 4 albums before he moved to Brighton/Brisbane. Here he finally found the right and locally well-known musicians he was looking for to form a band in 2019. Wolf’s Tales have been performing at many music venues in the Brisbane area (The BUG, various Yacht and Folk Clubs; 2x at Maleny Music Festival to name just a few). They have just released their first band album “Keep The Night Away” early December 2022.</p><p>Frank Frikker, songwriter, acoustic guitars, vocals<br><br>Frank Frikker is a German born Australian musician and singer/songwriter. Influenced by traditional European (e.g. Reinhard Mey, Rainhard Fendrich) and US/UK singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, James Taylor, Leonard Cohen and many others, he developed his own style of guitar picking and arranging songs. Frank has released 4 albums (Tomorrow I will be ok, Road Closed, Yarmouk, Anyway) and has finally recorded Keep the Night Away with the band in 2022. His songs/albums can be found on all the usual streaming platforms such as Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube, etc. or on <a href="http://geckomusicproductions.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://geckomusicproductions.com.au</a>            <br><br>Pete Hill on bass<br> <br>Pete has played guitar, bass and keyboards in loads of pub bands since the mid 70s. This has been mainly to provide a valid excuse to family and friends for his spending an inordinate amount of time in licensed premises. Pete’s eclectic influences include Santana, the Bondi Cigars, Stephen Cummings &amp; Geoff Achison. His little studio was home to a week of recording bass, several guitars and keyboard.<br><br>Steve Bedford on lead guitar (electric and acoustic)<br> <br>Steve is a very versatile and tasteful guitar player covering almost all genres (e.g. rock, blues, funk, jazz, country, folk). Steve started playing guitar over 40 years ago and has played in covers and tribute bands ever since. His early influences were Santana, John McLaughlin and Jeff Beck as well as Rush and the Doobie Brothers. Steve was later influenced by jazz players such as Larry Carlton and Lee Ritenour. During the ’00s he was the lead guitarist in a Santana tribute band before forming the Little Steely Brothers ten years ago. Steve has recorded one instrumental guitar-based album. </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__inner"><div class="content__updated">This article was updated on June 16, 2025</div><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--light btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://gapsoiree.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="section section--light footer" id="footer"><div class="footer__bottom"><div class="wrapper grid gap-8 sm:gap-10 lg:gap-24 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4"><div class="footer__item"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://gapsoiree.com/"><img src="https://gapsoiree.com/media/website/soiree-logo-black.png" alt="Soirée, a night of fabulous music" width="449" height="220"></a><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2025 Music Supporters Group, a sub-committee of The Gap State School P&amp;C</p></div></div><div class="footer__item"><h3 class="footer__heading">Contact Us</h3><p>Contact us through our socials or at <a href="mailto:info@gapsoiree.com">info@gapsoiree.com</a></p></div><div class="footer__item"><h3 class="footer__heading">Socials</h3><ul class="footer__list"><li><a href="https://fb.me/gapsoiree">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/gapsoiree">Instagram</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://gapsoiree.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f1ca04d6944a4073f1277cb59c568251"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
